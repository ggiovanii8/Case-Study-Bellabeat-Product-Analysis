# Case Study Bellabeat Product Analysis
## Company Information

Bellabeat, a tech-driven wellness company for women, has experienced remarkable growth since its establishment in 2013. With a range of five key products including the Bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring, and Bellabeat membership, the company has established itself as a prominent player in the industry. While currently a successful small company, Bellabeat holds the potential to expand its influence and presence in the global smart device market.

Our team has been entrusted with the task of analyzing smart device data to gain valuable insights into how consumers are utilizing their smart devices. By delving into this data, we aim to uncover patterns, behaviors, and preferences that will serve as a cornerstone for shaping the company's marketing strategy. Through our analysis, we seek to provide actionable recommendations that will help propel Bellabeat towards further success in the market.

## 1. Ask
ðŸ’¡The objective of this case study is to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices such as Leaf. The study aims to answer the following research questions:

Primary Stakeholders: UrÅ¡ka SrÅ¡en and Sando Mur, executive team members.

Secondary stakeholders: Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

a)	What are the most common features or functionalities utilized by consumers in non-Bellabeat smart devices? Can we identify the key activities or metrics that users engage with the most?

b)	How frequently do consumers interact with their non-Bellabeat smart devices? Can we determine the average daily or weekly usage duration and patterns?

c)	Are there any differences in usage patterns between different types or brands of non-Bellabeat smart devices? Can we identify any unique features or functionalities that differentiate one device from another?

d)	Can we identify any user segments or personas based on usage patterns of non-Bellabeat smart devices? Are there specific groups of users who utilize these devices in distinct ways?

## 2. Prepare 
For this case study, we will select a data set (FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made avialable through Mobius). The 18 Bellabeat datasets were initially opened in Excel for an initial assessment. They were filtered and sorted to check for blank entries, inconsistent naming, missing data, and potential duplicates.

Reliability: The data is sourced from only 30 FitBit users who provided consent for the submission of their personal tracker data. 

Originality: Data is sourced from a third-party survey by Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Comprehensive: The dataset includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While it tracks various factors related to user activity and sleep, it is important to note that the sample size is small. Additionally, most of the recorded data is concentrated on specific days of the week, which may impact its overall comprehensiveness for analysis purposes.

Current: The data encompasses the period from March 2016 to May 2016. However, it is not up-to-date, and users' habits may have changed since then.

Cited: The source of the dataset is Mobius via Kaggle. 

â›” The dataset has limitations:

  a)	The dataset consists of data from only 30 users. While the general rule of the central limit theorem (nâ‰¥30) allows for the use of t-tests, a larger sample size is preferred for more robust analysis.

  b)	Upon further investigation using the n_distinct() function to check for unique user IDs, it was discovered that the dataset contains data from 33 users for daily activity, 24 users for sleep, and only 8 users for weight tracking. This indicates the presence of three additional users, and some users did not record their data for daily activity and sleep tracking.

  c)	Most of the data provided didnâ€™t give important information on key characteristics that encompass gender, age, location, and lifestyle. 

  d)	Out of the 8 user data entries for weight, 5 users manually entered their weight, while 3 users recorded it using a connected Wi-Fi device (e.g., Wi-Fi scale).

  e)	Dataset is larger than what excel allows. Cleaning data will be done on RStudio.



## 3. Process

Packages were installed and opened to begin data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Examined the data by checking for missing values, and removing duplicates. 

#### Installing Packages

```install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "lubridate", "skimr", "plotrix", "geosphere", "scales", "forcats", "readr", "viridis"))```

#### Loading packages

```library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
library(plotrix)
library(geosphere)
library(scales)
library(forcats)
library(readr)
library(viridis)
```
#### Data importation

```
dailyActivity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
View(dailyActivity)

dailyCalories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
View(dailyCalories)

dailyIntensities <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
View(dailyIntensities)

dailySteps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
View(dailySteps)

heartrateSeconds <- read_csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
View(heartrateSeconds)

minuteMETs <- read_csv("minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
View(minuteMETs)

sleepDay <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
View(sleepDay)

weightLogInfo <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
View(weightLogInfo)
```
#### Processing data for analysis, checking for errors in data, picking tools, transforming the data, and documenting the cleaning process. Used head(), colnames(), and glimpse() to get a feel for the data. Didnâ€™t need to run it for ever dataset, but I wanted to see how different datasets looked when code was executed. Also looked for things Iâ€™d possibly have to change or fix.

```
head(dailyActivity)
colnames(dailyActivity)
glimpse(dailyActivity)

head(dailyCalories)
colnames(dailyCalories)
glimpse(dailyCalories)

head(dailyIntensities)
colnames(dailyIntensities)
glimpse(dailyIntensities)

head(dailySteps)
colnames(dailySteps)
glimpse(dailySteps)

head(heartrateSeconds)
colnames(heartrateSeconds)
glimpse(heartrateSeconds)

head(minuteMETs)
colnames(minuteMETs)
glimpse(minuteMETs)

head(sleepDay)
colnames(sleepDay)
glimpse(sleepDay)

head(weightLogInfo)
colnames(weightLogInfo)
glimpse(weightLogInfo)

colnames(weightLogInfo)[colnames(weightLogInfo) == "WeightPounds"] <- "Weightlbs"
colnames(weightLogInfo)
```

## 4. Analyze 

Used n_distinct(). This function is useful for understanding the level of variation within a dataset. With this we see the number of users in each dataset. Each dataset should have 33 participants. 

```
> n_distinct(dailyActivity$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(dailyCalories$Id)
[1] 33
> 
> n_distinct(dailyIntensities$Id)
[1] 33
> 
> n_distinct(dailySteps$Id)
[1] 33
> 
> n_distinct(heartrateSeconds$Id)
[1] 14
> 
> n_distinct(minuteMETs$Id)
[1] 33
> 
> n_distinct(sleepDay$Id)
[1] 24
> 
> n_distinct(weightLogInfo$Id)
[1] 8
```

heartrateSeconds is missing 16 participants.

sleepDay is missing 9 participants.

weightLogInfo is missing 25 participants. 

#### Converted dailyActivity into a date format, while also adding a column for the days of the week. 

```
dailyActivity <- dailyActivity %>% 
  mutate(weekday1 = weekdays(as.Date(ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y")))
glimpse(dailyActivity) 
dailyActivity$weekday1 <- ordered(dailyActivity$weekday1, levels=c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))
activityData <- dailyActivity %>% 
  group_by(weekday1) %>% 
  summarize(count_of = n())
glimpse(activityData)
```

#### Analyzing data set, aggregating our data so its usefull and accessible, organizing and formatting data and identifing trends & relationships. Viewed the dataset sleepDay, and wanted to see how much time was spent in bed before falling asleep. 
 
```
view(sleepDay)
Avg_minutes_asleep <- sleepDay %>% summarize(avg_sleeptime = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep))
Avg_minutes_asleep
AverageTimeInBed <- sleepDay %>%
summarize(AverageTimeInBed = mean(TotalTimeInBed))
AverageTimeInBed
```
#### Subtracting 419 from 459 gives us the amount of time the participants stayed in bed before falling asleep, which is an additional 40 minutes.

## 5. Share / Visualizations

#### Determining the best way to share my findings. Created effective data visualization. Presented findings and ensured our work was accessible.
